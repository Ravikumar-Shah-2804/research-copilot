# Papers Upload Endpoint Documentation

## Endpoint Overview

### URL Path
`/api/v1/papers/{paper_id}/upload` (assuming the router is mounted at `/api/v1/papers` in the main application; the endpoint is defined as `@router.post("/{paper_id}/upload")`)

### HTTP Method
POST

### Description
This endpoint is intended to allow authenticated users to upload a PDF file for an existing research paper. Currently, this functionality is not implemented and will return a "Not implemented yet" error.

### Dependencies
- Currently no dependencies as the endpoint is not implemented.
- Future implementation would likely involve file upload handling, PDF processing services, and repository updates.

## Authentication

### Requirements
- Authentication is mandatory and handled via the `get_current_active_user` dependency (from `src/services/auth.py`).
- The user must provide a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header (format: `Bearer <token>`).
- The token is decoded and verified to ensure the user is active.

### Required Headers
- `Authorization`: Bearer token (required for authentication; the token is validated via `get_current_active_user` dependency).

## Authorization

### Requirements
- No specific authorization checks beyond authentication; any active authenticated user would be able to upload PDFs (when implemented).

## Request

### Path Parameters
- **paper_id** (UUID, required): The unique identifier of the paper for which to upload the PDF.

### Request Body Schema
- Not applicable (endpoint not implemented; would likely accept multipart/form-data for file upload).

### Content-Type
- Not applicable (endpoint not implemented; would likely be `multipart/form-data`).

## Response

### Success Response
- **Status Code**: 501 Not Implemented
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`

### Response Schema
A simple error response indicating the endpoint is not implemented.

### Example Response (JSON)
```json
{
  "detail": "Not implemented yet"
}
```

## Error Responses

### 501 Not Implemented
- **Status Code**: 501
- **Message**: "Not implemented yet"
- **Condition**: Always triggered as the endpoint functionality has not been developed.

## Testing Example

### Example Command
```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/papers/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/upload' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhZG1pbiIsImV4cCI6MTc1ODg3MDc4OH0.GrXDnxCPAYJxm3rG33_0bP3hMJXTu5FX68uHHF1WV1I'
```

### Valid Request
```
POST /api/v1/papers/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/upload
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhZG1pbiIsImV4cCI6MTc1ODg3MDc4OH0.GrXDnxCPAYJxm3rG33_0bP3hMJXTu5FX68uHHF1WV1I
```

### Expected Output
```
StatusCode: 501
StatusDescription: Not Implemented
Content: {"detail": "Not implemented yet"}
```

Note: This endpoint is currently a placeholder and will be implemented in future development. When implemented, it would allow uploading PDF files to associate with existing papers for processing and content extraction.
